TODO
====
- Add doctrings
- Add documentation
- Fill the readme properly
    - Get a template from a nice library, and fill it
- CLI interface
    - Always ship with min interface
- License
- Saving the flashcards: should I handle this inside the generator? or leave this as a separate function?
  - If I handle it, how to handle the file naming? or this should be left to the user?
  - I am more tempted to
    - leave it to the user
    - Don't do the call from the generators
- Add flake8, mypy and isort to the pre-commit hooks
  - Test the conflict between isort and black formatter
  - Add the configurations for those in the `pyproject.toml`
- Add the testcases
- Add tox to orchestrate the testing
- Workflows
  - Testcases trigger on merge/push
  - mypy
- Add PyPi classifiers
- Check interacting with Anki via CLI `https://pypi.org/project/inka/`. Might lead to much easier experience for users
=======

Done
====
- Better OpenAI key handling logic: allow the user to add/point at `.env` file
- Parser modules
- Workflows
  - release
    - pre-release: release to testpypi
    - release: release to pypi
  - Flake8

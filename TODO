- Convert the OpenAI calling function to be async
  - GREAT for production on a server/website
- Saving the flashcards: should I handle this inside the generator? or leave this as a separate function?
  - If I handle it, how to handle the file naming? or this should be left to the user?
  - I am more tempted to
    - leave it to the user
    - Don't do the call from the generators
